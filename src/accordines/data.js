        question: "What is climate change and what are its main causes?",
        answer: "Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather patterns. While natural processes like volcanic eruptions and variations in solar cycles can contribute, the current trend is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat and result in global warming."

        question: "How does photosynthesis work in plants?",
        answer: "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The process uses carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, producing glucose and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂."

        question: "Why is the water cycle important for the environment?",
        answer: "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is essential because it distributes fresh water across the planet, supporting all forms of life. It involves processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. This continuous movement not only purifies water but also helps regulate Earth's temperature, supports plant growth, and replenishes groundwater supplies and natural reservoirs like lakes and rivers."

        question: "What are the main differences between renewable and nonrenewable energy?",
        answer: "Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. These sources are generally more environmentally friendly and sustainable over the long term. Nonrenewable energy, on the other hand, comes from sources like coal, oil, and natural gas, which exist in finite amounts and can take millions of years to form. Their extraction and use contribute heavily to environmental issues such as air pollution and global warming."

        question: "How did World War I begin?",
        answer: "World War I began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo. This event triggered a chain reaction of alliances and hostilities among major European powers. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, prompting Russia to mobilize in Serbia’s defense. Germany supported Austria-Hungary, while France and the United Kingdom entered the war on the side of Russia. The conflict rapidly expanded into a global war involving many nations and resulting in unprecedented destruction and loss of life."
